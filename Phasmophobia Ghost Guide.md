## 1. Spirit

**Description:**
Spirits are very common ghosts. They are very powerful, but passive, only attacking when they need to. They defend their place of death to the utmost degree, killing anyone that is caught overstaying their welcome.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Smudge Stick Deactivation:* Burning smudge sticks near a Spirit temporarily stops it from hunting for 3 minutes (180 seconds), instead of the standard 90 seconds for most ghosts.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Smudge Test:* If you smudge the ghost room or the ghost itself (e.g., during a hunt or event) and it doesn’t hunt for 3 minutes straight, especially at low sanity, it’s a strong indicator of a Spirit.
- *Evidence Collection:* Spirit Box is often a relatively easy piece of evidence to obtain for a Spirit.

**Strengths:**
- None explicitly listed in the journal. It is the only ghost without a defined strength in the game’s journal.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Extended Smudge Duration:* Can be temporarily stopped by burning smudge sticks near them for an extended duration (3 minutes).

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Smudge Sticks (crucial for identification)
- Lighter
- Timer (to check smudge duration)
- EMF Reader
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing Book

**Tips & Tactics:**
- The most reliable way to identify a Spirit without all evidence is the 3-minute smudge test. Ensure you time it accurately.
- Since it has no unique hunting behaviors or strengths, ruling out other ghosts can indirectly point to a Spirit if evidence is scarce.

## 2. Wraith

**Description:**
Wraiths are one of the most dangerous ghosts you will find. It is also the only known ghost that has the ability of flight and has sometimes been known to travel through walls (this refers to its teleportation ability).

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Spirit Box
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Teleportation:* Can teleport to a random player’s location on the map, leaving an EMF 2 or EMF 5 (if EMF 5 is evidence) reading at the player’s location where it teleported. It does not walk to the player; it appears instantly.
- *No Footsteps in Salt:* Does not step in salt piles. If a motion sensor over salt is triggered but the salt is undisturbed, it’s a strong sign of a Wraith.
- *Hunting Behavior:* Cannot teleport during a hunt. Does not fly or travel through walls during a hunt beyond normal ghost pathing.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Salt Test:* Place salt in a line in the ghost room or a high-traffic area. Place a motion sensor covering the salt. If the motion sensor triggers multiple times without the salt being disturbed, it is a Wraith. If salt *is* disturbed, it is *not* a Wraith.
- *EMF Teleport:* Carrying an EMF reader around the map. A sudden EMF 2 (or 5) reading when you are far from the known ghost area can indicate a Wraith teleporting to you.
- *Unexpected Presence:* If the ghost interacts or manifests far from its room unexpectedly, it might have teleported.

**Strengths:**
- *No Footprints:* Wraiths almost never touch the ground, meaning they can’t be tracked by footsteps (and thus won’t step in salt).

**Weaknesses:**
- *Salt Aversion (Debatable):* The journal states Wraiths have a toxic reaction to Salt. Historically, this meant increased activity after stepping in salt, but since they no longer step in it, this weakness is more of a lore point or tied to the fact they avoid it.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Salt (crucial for identification)
- Motion Sensor
- EMF Reader
- Spirit Box
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Tips & Tactics:**
- The salt test is the most definitive way to identify a Wraith. If salt is stepped in, it's 100% not a Wraith.
- If you suspect a Wraith, spread out and have players monitor EMF readers for teleports.
- Remember it cannot use its teleport ability during a hunt.

## 3. Phantom

**Description:**
A phantom is a ghost that can possess the living, inducing fear into those around it. They are most commonly summoned from Ouija boards (flavor text, not a gameplay mechanic).

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Fingerprints
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Player Roaming:* Can slowly walk towards any player on the map. Unlike the Wraith, it does not instantly teleport but rather sets a destination to a player and walks there.
- *Sanity Drain on Sight:* Viewing a Phantom during a ghost event or manifestation will cause a significant and rapid sanity drain.
- *Photo Disappearance:* Taking a photo of a Phantom will make it temporarily disappear and prevent sanity drain for a short period. The ghost model will vanish from sight, but the ghost is still present and can interact.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Sanity Observation:* Pay close attention to your sanity levels when the ghost performs a ghost event. If your sanity drops significantly just by looking at it, it's likely a Phantom.
- *Photo Test:* During a ghost event, take a photo of the ghost. If the ghost model disappears immediately after the photo is taken, it confirms a Phantom. The photo itself will still show the ghost.
- *Roaming Tracking:* If you suspect a Phantom, you can place a motion sensor far from the ghost room and observe if the ghost walks towards your location (triggering the sensor) rather than instantly appearing (like a Wraith).

**Strengths:**
- *Sanity Drain:* Viewing a Phantom will considerably drop your sanity.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Photo Vulnerability:* Taking a photo of the Phantom will make it temporarily disappear, allowing you to avoid sanity drain and potentially escape.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Photo Camera (essential for identification and sanity management)
- Spirit Box
- UV Light
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Motion Sensor (for advanced roaming detection)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Always have a photo camera ready when investigating a suspected Phantom. Snapping a picture during a ghost event is a quick way to confirm its identity and save sanity.
- Be extremely mindful of your sanity, as Phantoms can quickly deplete it, leading to early hunts.
- If you see a ghost event, try to get a photo even if you're not sure it's a Phantom, as it's a good habit for all ghost types.

## 4. Poltergeist

**Description:**
Poltergeists are one of the most well-known ghosts and can be very destructive. They are known to throw objects with great force, creating a lot of noise and chaos.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Fingerprints
- Ghost Writing

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Object Throwing:* Can throw objects with increased frequency and force. They are capable of throwing multiple objects at once (a 


Poltergeist throw).
- *Sanity Drain from Throws:* Multi-object throws can cause significant sanity drain, especially if many objects are thrown in quick succession.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Observing Throws:* The most obvious sign is observing multiple objects being thrown simultaneously or objects being thrown with unusual force and frequency.
- *Sound Cues:* Listen for frequent and loud object interactions. A parabolic microphone can help detect these from a distance.
- *Setup Test:* Place many small, light objects (e.g., books, pens, teddy bears) in the ghost room. If they are thrown rapidly and in large quantities, it strongly indicates a Poltergeist.

**Strengths:**
- *Mass Object Throws:* Can throw many objects at once, creating chaos and draining sanity.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Empty Room Powerless:* In an empty room (a room with no throwable objects), a Poltergeist is effectively powerless, as its primary ability relies on interacting with objects.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Spirit Box
- UV Light
- Ghost Writing Book
- Motion Sensors (to detect thrown objects and their trajectory)
- Parabolic Microphone (to detect distant object interactions)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- To confirm a Poltergeist, strategically place small items in the ghost room and observe for rapid, multi-object throws.
- Be prepared for rapid sanity drops if the Poltergeist is active with its throwing ability.
- If you suspect a Poltergeist, clearing the ghost room of throwable objects can make it less dangerous.

## 5. Banshee

**Description:**
A Banshee is a territorial ghost that will attack when threatened. It has been known to travel at extreme speeds (this is flavor text; its speed is normal).

**Primary Evidence:**
- Fingerprints
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Orb

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Targeted Victim:* A Banshee will choose one player as its victim and will only hunt that specific player. It will ignore other players, even if they have lower sanity.
- *Unique Wail:* Can perform a unique ghost event: a distinct wailing sound that only its chosen victim can hear.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Victim Hunt Test:* Observe hunts occurring when only one player has low sanity, or when the ghost ignores other low-sanity players during a hunt. If the ghost consistently targets the same player, it's a strong indicator.
- *Wail Event:* Listen for the unique wailing sound during a ghost event. If only one player hears it, it's a Banshee.
- *Crucifix Effectiveness:* Crucifixes placed near the chosen victim will be more effective at deterring hunts.

**Strengths:**
- *Single Target:* A Banshee will only target one person at a time, making it predictable for the victim but potentially dangerous for them.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Crucifix Fear:* Has a fear of the Crucifix and will be less aggressive when near one. This means Crucifixes have a larger effective range against a Banshee (5 meters instead of 3 meters).

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Crucifix (essential for deterrence and identification)
- UV Light
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Orb

**Tips & Tactics:**
- If you suspect a Banshee, have players with varying sanity levels. The one consistently targeted by hunts is the victim.
- Place Crucifixes strategically around the chosen victim, especially if they are exploring or gathering evidence.
- The unique wail is a definitive sign of a Banshee if heard by only one player.

## 6. Jinn

**Description:**
A Jinn is a territorial ghost that will attack when threatened. It has been known to travel at extreme speeds.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Fingerprints
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Speed Burst (Breaker On):* Can travel at extreme speeds when far from its target (player) if the breaker is on. It will slow down significantly when it gets close to the player.
- *Sanity Drain (Breaker On):* Can cause a large, instantaneous sanity drain (25% sanity) to all players in the house if the breaker is on and it uses its ability. This is often accompanied by an EMF 5 spike.
- *Breaker Interaction:* Will not turn off the breaker. If the breaker is off, it cannot use its speed burst or sanity drain abilities.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt (unless using its speed burst ability).

**Detection Methods:**
- *Speed Observation (Breaker On):* During a hunt, observe its speed. If it moves incredibly fast over long distances but then slows down dramatically as it approaches you, and the breaker is on, it's a Jinn.
- *Sanity Drain Spike:* Monitor sanity levels closely when the breaker is on. A sudden, large drop in sanity for all players, especially if accompanied by an EMF 5 spike, is a strong indicator.
- *Breaker Status:* If the breaker remains on throughout the investigation despite ghost activity, it supports a Jinn hypothesis.

**Strengths:**
- *High Speed:* A Jinn will travel at an extreme speed if its victim is far away, making it very dangerous in large rooms or long corridors.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Power Dependency:* Turning off the location’s power source (the breaker) will prevent the Jinn from using its speed burst and sanity drain abilities, making it a normal speed ghost during hunts.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- UV Light
- Thermometer
- Sanity Monitor (on the truck board)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Keep the breaker on initially to test for its unique abilities, but be prepared for rapid sanity drops.
- If a Jinn hunts, turning off the breaker can significantly reduce its threat, making it easier to escape.
- Pay close attention to the ghost's speed changes during a hunt, especially in relation to your distance from it.

## 7. Mare

**Description:**
A Mare is the source of all nightmares, making it most powerful in the dark. It will often flee from the light.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Light Sensitivity:* Has an increased chance to hunt in the dark and a reduced chance to hunt in the light.
- *Light Manipulation:* Will frequently attempt to turn off lights. It cannot turn on lights.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity, but this threshold is effectively lower (e.g., 40%) in the dark and higher (e.g., 60%) in the light.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Light Switch Observation:* Observe frequent attempts by the ghost to turn off light switches. If you turn on a light and it's immediately turned off, it's a strong sign.
- *Hunt Frequency (Light vs. Dark):* If the ghost hunts frequently when the lights are off, but rarely or never when the lights are on, it's a strong indicator of a Mare.
- *Light On/Off Test:* Try keeping lights on in the ghost room. If activity decreases or hunts are rare, then try turning off all lights and observe for increased activity and hunts.

**Strengths:**
- *Darkness Power:* Has an increased chance to attack in the dark, making it more dangerous in unlit areas.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Light Aversion:* Turning on the lights around the Mare will lower its chance to attack, effectively raising its hunting threshold.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing Book
- Thermometer
- Flashlights (to keep lights on)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Keep lights on in the ghost room and surrounding areas to deter hunts and make the investigation safer.
- If you want to confirm a Mare, intentionally turn off all lights and observe if it becomes significantly more active or hunts more frequently.
- Be cautious of sanity drain in dark areas, as Mares can be very aggressive there.

---

## 8. Revenant

**Description:**
A Revenant is a slow, but violent ghost that will attack indiscriminately. It has been known to travel at extreme speed when hunting.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Ghost Orb
- Ghost Writing
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Variable Hunt Speed:* Extremely fast during a hunt when it has line of sight on a player (e.g., 3 m/s). Very slow when it does not see a player during a hunt (e.g., 1 m/s).
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Speed Observation During Hunt:* The most definitive way to identify a Revenant is to observe its speed during a hunt. If it's incredibly fast when it sees you but becomes very slow the moment it loses line of sight, it's a Revenant.
- *Sound Cues:* Listen carefully to its footsteps during a hunt. The sound of its footsteps will change dramatically as it gains or loses line of sight, indicating its speed changes.

**Strengths:**
- *Blinding Speed:* Will travel at a significantly faster speed when hunting a victim it can see, making it one of the most dangerous ghosts in a direct chase.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Slow When Hidden:* Hiding from the Revenant or breaking line of sight will cause it to move very slowly, making it easier to escape or evade.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Ghost Orb
- Ghost Writing Book
- Thermometer
- Sound Sensor (to track its movement and speed changes)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- If a Revenant hunts, your priority is to break line of sight immediately. Duck into a hiding spot or loop around objects to slow it down.
- Do not attempt to outrun a Revenant in a straight line if it sees you.
- Use sound cues to determine if it has lost line of sight and slowed down, indicating it's safe to move.

## 9. Shade

**Description:**
A Shade is a shy ghost. There is evidence to suggest that the Shade will stop all paranormal activity if there is more than one person nearby.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Ghost Writing
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Activity Based on Players:* Less active (fewer interactions, ghost events) when multiple players are in the same room. More active when only one player is present in its room.
- *Hunting Restriction:* Cannot perform ghost events or initiate a hunt if multiple players are in its room. It will only hunt if there is one player in its room or if all players are outside its room.
- *Shadowy Manifestation:* Can perform a unique ghost event where it appears as a shadowy, translucent figure. This manifestation does not drain sanity.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Activity Test (Solo vs. Group):* Observe a significant lack of paranormal activity when multiple players are in the ghost room, but a noticeable increase in activity when only one player is present.
- *Ghost Event Type:* Look for the shadowy figure ghost event. If you see a ghost event that looks like a shadowy figure and does not drain your sanity, it's a strong indicator of a Shade.
- *Hunt Prevention:* If the ghost consistently refuses to hunt even at low sanity when multiple players are together, but hunts when a single player is isolated, it's likely a Shade.

**Strengths:**
- *Shy Hunter:* Being shy, the ghost will not enter a hunt if there is more than one person nearby in its room, making it safer for groups.

**Weaknesses:**
- *No Traces with Group:* It will not leave behind any trace of its presence (e.g., interactions, ghost events) if there are multiple people nearby, making it harder to find evidence in groups.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- Ghost Writing Book
- Thermometer
- Video Camera (to observe shadowy manifestations)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- If you suspect a Shade, have one player enter the ghost room alone to encourage activity and evidence collection.
- Pay close attention to ghost events; the shadowy figure without sanity drain is a key identifier.
- In multiplayer, if the ghost is unusually quiet, try splitting up to provoke activity.

---

## 10. Demon

**Description:**
Demons are one of the most dangerous ghosts you can encounter. They are known for their extreme aggression and frequent hunts.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Fingerprints
- Ghost Writing
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Early Hunts:* Can hunt at a much higher sanity threshold (70% average sanity), making it one of the earliest hunting ghosts.
- *Short Smudge Duration:* Smudge sticks only deter a Demon for 60 seconds (instead of the standard 90 seconds), making them less effective for prolonged safety.
- *Aggressive Events:* Can perform ghost events that drain a large amount of sanity.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a very high 70% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Early Hunt Observation:* The most significant indicator is frequent hunts occurring at high sanity levels (above 50%).
- *Smudge Timer Test:* Use a smudge stick during a hunt or event and time how long it takes for the ghost to be able to hunt again. If it's 60 seconds, it's a Demon.
- *Sanity Drain from Events:* Noticeable large sanity drops from ghost events can also be a clue.

**Strengths:**
- *Aggressive Hunter:* Demons are the most aggressive ghosts and will hunt more often and at higher sanity thresholds.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Ouija Board Sanity:* Asking a Demon a successful question on the Ouija Board will not lower the user’s sanity, unlike other ghosts.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Ouija Board (for weakness confirmation)
- Smudge Sticks (essential for survival)
- Lighter
- UV Light
- Ghost Writing Book
- Thermometer

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Be extremely cautious of early hunts. Always have an escape plan and hiding spot ready, even if your sanity is high.
- Use smudge sticks frequently to buy time, but be aware of their shorter duration compared to other ghosts.
- If you have a Ouija Board, try asking a question. If your sanity doesn't drop, it's a strong sign of a Demon.

---

## 11. Yurei

**Description:**
A Yurei is a ghost that has returned to the physical world to seek revenge or complete an unfinished task. They are known for their strong connection to doors.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Ghost Orb
- Freezing Temperatures
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Door Slamming:* Can completely close a door, not just interact with it (e.g., open or partially close). This is a distinct, forceful slam.
- *Sanity Drain (Door Slam):* Can drain a large amount of sanity (15% sanity) when it uses its door-slamming ability.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Door Observation:* Observe doors completely closing on their own with a distinct slam, rather than just opening or shutting partially. This is the primary tell.
- *Sanity Drop After Door:* Notice significant sanity drops immediately after a door slams shut.
- *Smudge Trap:* Smudging a Yurei will trap it in its current room for a longer period (90 seconds) than other ghosts, preventing it from roaming.

**Strengths:**
- *Sanity Drain:* Has the ability to drain a significant amount of sanity through its door-slamming ability.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Smudge Trapping:* Using a smudge stick on a Yurei will trap it in its room for a long period of time (90 seconds), preventing it from roaming and making it easier to manage.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Smudge Sticks (for trapping and identification)
- Lighter
- Ghost Orb
- Thermometer
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Tips & Tactics:**
- If a door slams shut completely and forcefully, it's a very strong indicator of a Yurei.
- Smudge the ghost room to prevent it from roaming and to confirm its identity through its weakness.
- Be aware of your sanity when doors are slamming, as it can drop quickly.

---

## 12. Oni

**Description:**
Oni are demonic ghosts that possess immense strength. They are known for their aggressive nature and frequent interactions.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Writing

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Activity with Players:* More active (more interactions, ghost events) when players are nearby. Less active when players are far away.
- *No Shadowy Figure:* Cannot perform the shadowy figure ghost event (unlike a Shade).
- *Increased Object Throws:* Has an increased chance of throwing objects, often with more force.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Activity Observation:* Observe increased activity and interactions when players are in the ghost room, especially compared to when players are outside the room.
- *Ghost Event Type:* Notice a complete lack of shadowy figure ghost events. If you see a ghost event, it will always be a full-bodied manifestation.
- *Frequent Throws:* Frequent and forceful object throwing is a good indicator.

**Strengths:**
- *Aggressive Interactions:* Oni are more active when people are nearby and will throw objects at great speed, making them easier to find and provoke.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Predictable Activity:* Being active makes the Oni easier to find and identify, as its constant interactions provide more opportunities for evidence.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Writing Book
- Sound Sensor (to track interactions)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Stay close to the ghost room to encourage activity and gather evidence quickly.
- If you see a lot of object throwing and full-bodied ghost events, consider an Oni.
- Its constant activity can be a double-edged sword; it's easier to find but also more prone to causing sanity drain.

---

## 13. Yokai

**Description:**
A Yokai is a ghost that is highly sensitive to sound. It is known to be easily provoked by talking nearby.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Orb
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Sound-Provoked Hunts:* Has a significantly increased chance to hunt when players are talking near it (within 10 meters).
- *Limited Hearing during Hunt:* When hunting, a Yokai can only hear voices very close to it (within 2-3 meters), making it easier to hide from if you stay silent.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Talking Test:* If the ghost hunts frequently when players are talking in the ghost room or nearby, especially at higher sanity levels than expected, it's a strong indicator of a Yokai.
- *Hunt Evasion Test:* During a hunt, try talking from a distance while hiding. If the ghost doesn't seem to react to your voice unless you are very close, it supports a Yokai hypothesis.

**Strengths:**
- *Sound Aggression:* Talking near a Yokai will anger it and significantly increase its chance of attacking, making it easier to provoke hunts for testing.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Short-Range Hearing:* When hunting, a Yokai can only hear voices close to it, making it easier to evade by staying silent and maintaining distance.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Orb
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Parabolic Microphone (to detect ghost sounds from a distance without talking)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Avoid talking in the ghost room if you suspect a Yokai, especially at low sanity, to prevent early hunts.
- During a hunt, stay completely silent and move away from the ghost to avoid detection.
- You can use talking to intentionally provoke a hunt for identification purposes, but be prepared to hide immediately.

## 14. Hantu

**Description:**
A Hantu is a cold and calculating ghost that thrives in freezing temperatures. It is known for its speed in colder environments.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Fingerprints
- Ghost Orb
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Temperature-Dependent Speed:* Moves faster in colder temperatures (e.g., in a freezing room, or when the breaker is off). Moves slower in warmer temperatures (e.g., near a lit breaker, or in a room with a lit candle).
- *Forced Freezing Temperatures:* Will always have Freezing Temperatures as one of its pieces of evidence.
- *Breaker Interaction:* Cannot turn on the breaker. If the breaker is off, it will remain off unless a player turns it on.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Speed Test During Hunt:* The most reliable way to identify a Hantu is to observe its speed during a hunt in different temperature zones. Turn the breaker off and observe its speed, then turn it on and observe if it slows down significantly.
- *Consistent Freezing Temps:* If you consistently get Freezing Temperatures as evidence, it narrows down the possibilities, and combined with speed changes, points to a Hantu.

**Strengths:**
- *Cold Speed:* Moves faster in colder temperatures, making it very dangerous in freezing rooms or when the breaker is off.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Heat Slowdown:* Moves slower in warmer temperatures. Turning on the breaker or using a lit candle in the ghost room will significantly reduce its hunting speed.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Thermometer (essential for temperature readings)
- UV Light
- Ghost Orb
- Lighter/Candle (to create warm spots)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Keep the breaker on to slow down a Hantu during a hunt, making it easier to escape.
- Use a thermometer to confirm freezing temperatures and observe how temperature changes affect its speed.
- If you are being hunted by a Hantu, try to lead it through warmer areas of the house.

## 15. Goryo

**Description:**
A Goryo is a vengeful spirit that is bound to its place of death. It is known for its strong connection to D.O.T.S Projectors.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Fingerprints
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Camera-Only D.O.T.S:* D.O.T.S Projector evidence is *only* visible through a video camera (either handheld or on a tripod). It will *not* appear if a player is in the same room as the D.O.T.S Projector.
- *Limited Roaming:* Rarely roams far from its place of death (its ghost room), making it more predictable in terms of location.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *D.O.T.S Camera Test:* Place a D.O.T.S Projector in the ghost room and observe it remotely from the truck or another room using a video camera. If D.O.T.S appears only on camera and not when you are physically in the room, it's a Goryo.
- *Roaming Observation:* Its tendency to stay in its ghost room can be a subtle clue, especially if other ghosts are roaming more.

**Strengths:**
- *Stealthy D.O.T.S:* D.O.T.S Projector evidence is only visible through a video camera, making it harder to obtain without proper setup.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Stationary:* Rarely roams far from its place of death, making its location more predictable.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- D.O.T.S Projector (essential for identification)
- Video Camera (essential for D.O.T.S observation)
- Tripod (for remote D.O.T.S observation)
- EMF Reader
- UV Light

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Always set up a video camera to monitor the D.O.T.S Projector for a Goryo. This is the most reliable way to get its unique evidence.
- Do not stand in the ghost room when trying to get D.O.T.S evidence for a Goryo; observe from a distance.
- Its limited roaming can help narrow down its location if you're struggling to find the ghost room.

## 16. Myling

**Description:**
A Myling is a ghost that is known for its quiet nature. It is known to be almost silent during a hunt.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Fingerprints
- Ghost Writing

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Silent Hunts:* Ghost footsteps and vocalizations (e.g., growls, whispers) are much quieter during a hunt, making it difficult to pinpoint its location by sound alone.
- *Electronic Interference:* Electronic equipment (flashlights, EMF readers, cameras) will flicker more frequently and at a greater range when a Myling is nearby, especially during a hunt.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Sound Test During Hunt:* During a hunt, listen very carefully for footsteps. If they are unusually quiet or almost inaudible, it's a strong indicator of a Myling.
- *Electronic Flicker Test:* Observe the flickering of electronic equipment. If your flashlight flickers rapidly and consistently when the ghost is close, even when it's not hunting, it can be a Myling. During a hunt, the increased flicker range is a key tell.
- *Parabolic Microphone:* Use a parabolic microphone to detect its sounds from a distance. If you hear ghost sounds on the parabolic microphone but not with your ears, it's a Myling.

**Strengths:**
- *Stealthy Hunter:* A Myling will make very little to no sound when hunting, making it difficult for players to track its position by audio cues.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Audible Interactions:* Mylings will make paranormal sounds (e.g., whispers, growls, interactions) more frequently than other ghosts, making them easier to locate outside of a hunt.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- UV Light
- Ghost Writing Book
- Parabolic Microphone (essential for identification)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Use a parabolic microphone to detect its sounds from a distance, as this is often the only way to hear it clearly.
- Pay close attention to electronic equipment flickering as a proximity indicator during a hunt, as its footsteps will be hard to hear.
- If you suspect a Myling, rely more on visual cues (flickering lights) and less on audio cues during a hunt.

## 17. Onryo

**Description:**
An Onryo is a vengeful spirit that is bound to its place of death. It is known for its strong connection to flames.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Orb
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Flame Extinguish Hunt:* Has an increased chance to hunt when a flame (e.g., candle, lighter) is extinguished nearby. Each extinguished flame acts as a 


crucifix for the Onryo, preventing a hunt once per flame.
- *Flame Extinguishing:* Can actively extinguish flames (candles, lighters) more frequently than other ghosts.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Flame Extinguish Test:* Place lit candles in the ghost room. If the ghost frequently extinguishes them, and especially if a hunt immediately follows an extinguished flame, it's a strong indicator of an Onryo.
- *Crucifix Replacement:* Observe if crucifixes are not being used, but candles are being extinguished and preventing hunts. Each extinguished candle acts like a crucifix for an Onryo.

**Strengths:**
- *Flame-Triggered Hunts:* Extinguishing a flame can cause an Onryo to attack, making it unpredictable if not managed.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Flame Deterrence:* The presence of flames (lit candles) will reduce the chance of an Onryo attacking, effectively raising its hunting threshold. Each lit candle acts as a mini-crucifix.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Candles (essential for identification and deterrence)
- Lighter
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Orb
- Thermometer

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Keep multiple candles lit in the ghost room to deter hunts and observe its behavior. If it extinguishes them, you know it's an Onryo.
- If you suspect an Onryo, you can intentionally extinguish a candle to provoke a hunt and confirm its identity, but be prepared to hide.
- Always have a lighter ready to relight candles.

## 18. The Twins

**Description:**
The Twins are two separate ghostly entities that work together to confuse and disorient their victims. One is the main ghost (The Real Twin), and the other is a decoy (The Ghost Twin).

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Spirit Box
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Simultaneous Interactions:* Both The Real Twin and The Ghost Twin can interact with the environment simultaneously in different locations on the map.
- *Decoy Mimicry:* The Ghost Twin can mimic ghost events and interactions, but it cannot initiate a hunt.
- *Variable Hunt Speed:* The Real Twin hunts at normal speed. The Ghost Twin (decoy) moves slower during a hunt, and The Real Twin can sometimes move faster or slower than normal during a hunt.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Simultaneous Interactions:* The most definitive sign is observing two distinct ghost interactions happening at the exact same time in different rooms or far apart locations.
- *Footstep Speed During Hunt:* During a hunt, listen carefully to the ghost's footsteps. If the speed seems inconsistent, or if you hear footsteps that are slower than normal, it could be The Twins.
- *Interaction Location:* If you get an interaction far from the ghost room, and then another interaction quickly in the ghost room, it could be The Twins.

**Strengths:**
- *Dual Presence:* Both Twins can interact with the environment at the same time, making it difficult to pinpoint the true ghost location.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Mimicry Confusion:* The Twins will often mimic each other, making it difficult to tell which one is real (the hunting ghost) and which is the decoy.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- Spirit Box
- Thermometer
- Sound Sensors (to cover multiple areas and detect simultaneous interactions)
- Motion Sensors

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Place sound sensors or motion sensors in different areas of the house to track simultaneous interactions and identify The Twins.
- During a hunt, pay close attention to the ghost's speed and footstep sounds. Inconsistent speeds are a key tell.
- Don't rely solely on one interaction to pinpoint the ghost room; observe multiple interactions to see if they are spread out.

## 19. Raiju

**Description:**
A Raiju is a creature that thrives on electrical energy. It is known to be highly active around electronic equipment.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Orb

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Speed Boost Near Electronics:* Moves significantly faster when near active electronic equipment (e.g., flashlights, cameras, EMF readers, Spirit Boxes, video cameras, sound sensors, motion sensors, parabolic microphones) that players are holding or have placed.
- *Increased Electronic Interference:* Causes electronic equipment to flicker more frequently and at a greater range than other ghosts, especially during a hunt.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Speed Test During Hunt:* During a hunt, observe its speed. If it moves extremely fast when you are holding active electronic equipment or are near placed electronic equipment, but slows down when electronics are off or far away, it's a Raiju.
- *Electronic Flicker Observation:* Notice frequent and intense flickering of electronic equipment, especially during a hunt, even when the ghost is not extremely close.

**Strengths:**
- *Electrical Energy Absorption:* A Raiju can absorb electrical energy, making it move faster when near active electronic devices, making it very dangerous in areas with a lot of equipment.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Overload Slowdown:* Overloading a Raiju with electrical energy (e.g., by having many electronics on) will cause it to temporarily slow down (this is often misinterpreted; its weakness is simply that it is slower when *not* near electronics, not that it overloads).

**Recommended Equipment:**
- EMF Reader
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Ghost Orb
- Flashlight (for testing speed changes)
- Video Camera (to observe flicker range)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- During a hunt, turn off all electronic equipment (especially your flashlight) to slow down a Raiju and make it easier to escape.
- Be aware that leaving many electronic devices on in the ghost room can make the Raiju extremely fast and dangerous.
- Use the increased electronic interference as a proximity indicator, especially during a hunt.

## 20. Obake

**Description:**
Obake are shapeshifting ghosts that can take on different forms. They are known for leaving unique evidence.

**Primary Evidence:**
- EMF Level 5
- Fingerprints
- Ghost Orb

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Unique Fingerprints:* Can leave unique fingerprints that are different from standard ghost fingerprints. This includes: 6 fingers on light switches, 2 fingers on doors, or a handprint with an extra finger.
- *Shapeshifting Manifestation:* Can change its ghost model during a ghost event or manifestation. This is a visual change in its appearance.
- *Evidence Disappearance:* Can sometimes remove one piece of evidence (e.g., a fingerprint) after an interaction, making it harder to confirm.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.
- *Speed:* Normal movement speed; speeds up when it has line of sight on a player during a hunt.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Fingerprint Inspection:* The most definitive way to identify an Obake is to look for its unique fingerprints. Always check light switches and doors with a UV light after interactions for unusual patterns (6 fingers, 2 fingers, or extra finger on handprint).
- *Visual Shapeshifting:* Observe if the ghost model changes its appearance during a ghost event. This is a rare but definitive visual cue.
- *Missing Evidence:* If you are certain you saw a piece of evidence (e.g., a fingerprint) but it disappears shortly after, it could be an Obake.

**Strengths:**
- *Elusive Traces:* When interacting with the environment, an Obake will rarely leave a trace, or may remove traces, making it harder to confirm its presence.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Unique Fingerprints:* Sometimes leaves unique fingerprints, which are a definitive identifier if found.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- UV Light (essential for fingerprint detection)
- Photo Camera (to capture unique fingerprints)
- EMF Reader
- Ghost Orb

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Always carry a UV light and diligently check for fingerprints on all interacted objects, especially light switches and doors.
- Be vigilant for any visual changes in the ghost's appearance during ghost events.
- Take photos of any suspicious fingerprints immediately.

## 21. The Mimic

**Description:**
The Mimic is a mysterious ghost that can imitate the characteristics of other ghosts. It is known for its ability to copy evidence.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Fingerprints
- Freezing Temperatures
- *Always has Ghost Orb:* The Mimic will *always* have Ghost Orbs as evidence, regardless of what ghost it is mimicking or what other evidence it presents. This is its unique fourth evidence.

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Mimicry:* Can mimic the abilities and behaviors of any other ghost type, including their hunting thresholds, speeds, and unique interactions. It can change which ghost it is mimicking throughout the investigation.
- *Ghost Orb Constant:* Always produces Ghost Orbs, even if the ghost it is mimicking does not have Ghost Orbs as primary evidence.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Varies depending on the ghost it is mimicking.
- *Speed:* Varies depending on the ghost it is mimicking.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Fourth Evidence (Ghost Orb):* The most definitive way to identify The Mimic is to find Ghost Orbs along with three other pieces of evidence that do not correspond to any single ghost type. For example, if you find EMF 5, Spirit Box, Freezing Temps, AND Ghost Orbs, it's a Mimic.
- *Inconsistent Behavior:* Observe inconsistent ghost behavior or abilities that seem to change throughout the investigation. For example, if it acts like a Mare at one point and then a Jinn later.

**Strengths:**
- *Adaptability:* Can mimic the abilities and behaviors of other ghosts, making it highly unpredictable and difficult to identify.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Predictable Orb:* Always has Ghost Orbs as evidence, providing a consistent clue despite its mimicry.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Ghost Orb (essential for identification)
- Spirit Box
- UV Light
- Thermometer
- Video Camera (to confirm Ghost Orbs)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- If you find Ghost Orbs but the other two pieces of evidence you have (or suspect) don't match any single ghost type, strongly consider The Mimic.
- Be prepared for its behavior to change. What you observe early in the investigation might not be what you see later.
- It's crucial to rule out all other ghosts based on their unique behaviors and evidence combinations.

## 22. Moroi

**Description:**
Moroi are cursed spirits that feed on the sanity of their victims. They are known for their rapid sanity drain and increased speed when players have low sanity.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing
- Freezing Temperatures

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Sanity Drain Proximity:* Causes rapid sanity drain when a player is near it, even outside of ghost events.
- *Speed Based on Sanity:* Moves faster when players have lower average sanity. The lower the average sanity, the faster the Moroi will be during a hunt.
- *Extended Smudge Blindness:* Smudge sticks blind a Moroi for a longer duration during a hunt (12 seconds instead of 6 seconds), making it easier to escape.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Rapid Sanity Drain:* Observe unusually rapid sanity drain, even when not experiencing ghost events or being hunted, especially when in the ghost room.
- *Speed Change with Sanity:* Notice the ghost's speed increasing significantly as the team's average sanity decreases during a hunt.
- *Extended Smudge Blindness:* If smudging the ghost during a hunt blinds it for an extended period (12 seconds), it's a Moroi.

**Strengths:**
- *Sanity-Driven Speed:* The lower the player’s average sanity, the faster the Moroi will be, making it increasingly dangerous as the investigation progresses.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Extended Smudge Blindness:* Smudging the Moroi will blind it for a longer period of time during a hunt, providing more time to escape or hide.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing Book
- Thermometer
- Smudge Sticks (essential for survival and identification)
- Lighter

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Keep sanity high to avoid its increased speed. Use sanity pills frequently.
- During a hunt, use smudge sticks to blind it for longer, providing a crucial advantage for escape.
- Pay close attention to the ghost's speed in relation to your team's average sanity.

## 23. Deogen

**Description:**
A Deogen is a ghost that is constantly aware of its victims. It is known for its ability to always know where players are.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Variable Hunt Speed:* Extremely fast when far from a player during a hunt (e.g., 3 m/s). Extremely slow when close to a player during a hunt (e.g., 0.4 m/s).
- *Constant Awareness:* Can always sense players, even when they are hiding in lockers or closets. It will path directly to a player's hiding spot.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Hunts at a normal 50% average sanity.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Speed Test During Hunt:* The most definitive way to identify a Deogen is to observe its speed during a hunt. If it's incredibly fast when far away but becomes very slow the moment it gets close to you, it's a Deogen.
- *Hiding Spot Test:* Attempt to hide from the ghost. If it consistently finds you in hiding spots that would normally be safe, it's a Deogen.

**Strengths:**
- *Omnipresent Sense:* Can always sense the living, making hiding impossible.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Proximity Slowdown:* Extremely slow when close to a player during a hunt, making it easy to loop and escape if you understand its mechanic.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Spirit Box
- Ghost Writing Book
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Tips & Tactics:**
- During a Deogen hunt, do NOT hide. Instead, run towards the Deogen to slow it down, then loop it around objects (tables, furniture) to evade it.
- This ghost requires a different approach to survival than most others. Practice looping it.

## 24. Thayé

**Description:**
A Thayé is a ghost that ages rapidly when players are nearby. It is known for its decreasing activity and speed over time.

**Primary Evidence:**
- Ghost Orb
- Ghost Writing
- D.O.T.S Projector

**Abilities & Behaviors:**
- *Aging Mechanic:* Starts very active and fast (higher hunting threshold, more interactions) at the beginning of the investigation. Becomes progressively less active and slower over time as players remain in the house and are near it.
- *Decreasing Hunt Threshold:* Its hunting threshold decreases over time. When it's 'young' (early in the investigation), it might hunt at 75% sanity. As it 'ages', its threshold can drop to 15% sanity.
- *Speed Change:* Its hunting speed also decreases as it ages.
- *Hunting Threshold:* Starts high (e.g., 75%) and decreases over time.
- *Speed:* Starts fast and slows down over time.

**Detection Methods:**
- *Activity/Speed Decay:* Observe a significant decrease in ghost activity (fewer interactions, less frequent ghost events) and hunting speed as the investigation progresses and you spend more time in the house.
- *Early High Sanity Hunt:* If you experience a hunt very early in the investigation at a high sanity level (e.g., 70-75%), it's a strong indicator of a 'young' Thayé.

**Strengths:**
- *Initial Power:* The Thayé will become more powerful (more active, faster, higher hunting threshold) when players are nearby, especially at the start of the investigation.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Aging Weakness:* The Thayé will become weaker (less active, slower, lower hunting threshold) over time as it 'ages' due to player presence.

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Ghost Orb
- Ghost Writing Book
- D.O.T.S Projector
- Thermometer (to confirm ghost room early)

**Tips & Tactics:**
- Try to identify a Thayé early in the investigation when it is most active and its unique behaviors are most pronounced.
- Be aware that its hunting threshold will become lower and its speed will decrease as time passes, making it less dangerous later in the investigation.
- If you suspect a Thayé, try to get evidence quickly before it 'ages' too much.
